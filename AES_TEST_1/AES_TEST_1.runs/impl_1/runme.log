WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net i_cipher_enc_reg[251]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin i_cipher_enc_reg[251]_i_1/O, cell i_cipher_enc_reg[251]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
